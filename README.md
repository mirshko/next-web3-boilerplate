[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmirshko%2Fnext-web3-boilerplate)

This is a default [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), customized as the default boilerplate for new Web3 projects.

## Features

- Separate packages from ethers.js for improved tree-shaking, often only ethers Contracts
- Hooks-first approach to fetching and caching data from Contracts and memoization for performance with SWR
- web3-react for ease of connecting to Web3 providers with a solid API
